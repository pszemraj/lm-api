 ## The explanation I heard during class of directed acyclic graph in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


For each node, you need to assign a probability of being true for every possible assignment (e.g., P(Y_i = 1) is 0.6). Then, do a forward search from each outcome to all other nodes and for all paths in which that path has been visited have its probabilities multiplied together by normalizing their product. The resulting vector will be your probability estimate for that node's outcome given your model (e.g., if you had 1000 outcomes, then there would be 2^1000 possible outcomes).

d-separation (in a causal graph) is implemented by structural equation models and conditional independence tests.
In practice, you will often encounter situations where you have to make an assumption about past interventions on one or more nodes. A very common scenario is that you are interested in finding out whether treatment Z has any effect (possibly after controlling for other variables), however, your data do not record who was treated with Z but only which individuals were affected by treatment Z; therefore, you cannot infer anything about the effect of treatment Z on y from these data without making an assumption about what subset of those with observed values for y are likely to also have been treated with Z.

Response: 


When n observations are made, DAGs have 2^n possible structures (2 raised to the power of n). 

One way to avoid wasting time on uninteresting models is to use a greedy algorithm that starts with an empty graph.At each step, add an edge between two variables whose corresponding parents differ by at most one.This greedy algorithm ensures that each new variable only appears in a single parent at any time. The algorithm terminates when there are no more edges for adding (i.e., when there is no pair of variables whose corresponding parents differ by one) or no more ways to order them so that this is true for all pairs (this can be easily checked). At this point, we have found our final DAG. It contains a v-structure and $e_v$ edges between its non-descendants above v and its descendants below v, which correspond exactly to our notion of "partial correlations", or conditional independences given the other relevant variables; see here for how these ideas connect with Pearl's do operator in particular.)

1- you need to be able to fit a linear model on X and Y (or at least have a way to infer the value of Y for certain values of X).
2- in order for this method to be valid, you must ensure that there are not any confounds in your data: if say $x_i$ is an important feature that affects both $X_i$ and $Y$, then just including both it's values as regressors would result in biased estimates.

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Observational distribution in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1) include only those units that provide useful information for estimating $Y$ (don't include units where $U$ is not known due to missing values). 2) estimate $\hat{Y}$ using only the units that are included in a sample, with some appropriate weighting method. 3) use $\hat{Y}$ and its variance to adjust $\bar{X}$.
To me this looks like step 1 would be equivalent to matching on the covariates so that your sample is balanced on those characteristics, which would then make step 2 unnecessary. It seems odd though because you are including observations if they have missing values but if you were also including them in your weighting scheme then why bother with step 1? Are there any good reasons for doing so or should we just let all observations be part of our estimation? 
Aside from this, what are some other possible scenarios where a partial observation might occur naturally? For instance I'm assuming it would be impossible to have a situation where an observation has no value for U (or X). But what about cases when there isn't enough time between two consecutive observations (e.g., every 5 minutes)? Or when someone's cellphone battery dies before they can submit their data?

 "if you want to be a good cause analsis", "you need to check for interactions", etc.
I am not sure why there is no mention of this method in some other books, maybe they just do not provide an implementation. Certainly, one needs something like that if one wants to use this method in their own work.
However, the book does mention another common approach called instrumental variables (which has gained popularity since that time). But I find instrumental variable analysis harder than interventional analysis and have only used it once or twice when faced with a situation where there are many problems with using interventional methods but no apparent problems with IV methods.
It seems that people who use IV methods generally have more experience than those who use interventional methods (although other things being equal). If you are thinking of learning then which method should you start with? Maybe both?But it seems clear that we should learn how to apply these two types of analyses together because they complement each other very nicely -- epecially when there is uncertainty about which mechanism is actually operating!

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Instrumental variable in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 
 "it is a bit more robust than other approaches for being able to consider multiple instruments", "it is possible that there are variables that have no direct effect on Y but can affect X, since we use them as instruments for X, we need to control if they have any effect on Y".
I'm referring specifically about this part of his description:

One important condition is that there must be a relationship between these two sets of variables. The instrumental variable approach relies on drawing inferences from the assumption that, conditional on some instrument Zs, all unmeasured factors affecting both X and Y are uncorrelated with Zs (this assumption is known as exogeneity). 

I don't get how this works in practice (also indicated by answers here), for instance with respect to my example above:
Let's assume these are true or valid instruments: 
1)An increase in social security pension amount by one unit increases unemployment rate by 0.1% per year at national level. 
2)A change in one euro of minimum wage increases employment rate by 0.5%. 
We can see already now that they aren't true or valid because each time you increase minimum wage employment rate decreases while unemployment increases.... So how do you actually use them?!? If your estimate

let $X_i$ be "I am willing to work hard" and let $Y_i$ be "I get paid \$100".
With just these variables there is no difference between your group and mine. We can run an OLS regression on all our observations or we can look at each one's potential outcome for those who don't receive treatment:

> x1 <- c(1, 0, 0, 1) # this person gets treatment

Defining two more variables (U and V). For every case where X = 1, U=1 and V=1; for all other cases, U=0 and V=0. 
Then, you can follow these steps: 

E(X|U = 0 & U = 1) is equal to P(X = 1 | U = 0 & U = 1), which is the same as P(X|V ) because X is independent of both u & v when u = v using rule of sum in probability theory; 
E(Y|U,V ) here is equal to E(Y|V ), since Y only depends on {u} when u=v.

1.In this lecture we saw that, under certain conditions, we can calculate the distribution of future values of a time-varying (or time-invariant) random variable given a sequence of past values. The variables in play need not be independent; they are only assumed to be “conditionally independent”. In particular, if Xt is a discrete rv with finite state space S = {1, 2,…}, then P(Xt+1 = i | X1=i_0,..., Xt=it ) = P(Xi+1 = i | Xi = i) for every t >= 1 and every i ∈ S (6.2). This is called “the Markov property” for discrete times. It turns out that we can also define an analogue of this notion for general stochastic processes {Xt}tt∈T ; namely, if ƒ is any measurable function from T to R, then E[ƒ(Xt+1)|X_T ] should equal E[ƒ(Xi+1)|Xi=i], which holds when f satisfies ƒ(Y) = g where Y ∼ Bi and g is any constant function on S (6.3).

 ## The explanation I heard during class of faithfulness Conditions in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1) Always include relevant variables in your model (whether you think they are related or not). For example, if you measure patient’s age at admission, always include this variable because age is an important predictor of mortality.

2) Remove a variable from a model if its effect on outcome is nullified by another variable. For example, for each group, calculate the difference in mortality between patients with blood types A and B; if this difference is greater than zero then we can safely conclude that type B blood has a protective effect on ICU death relative to type A blood; therefore we can exclude it from our model. In other words: look for confounding variables when looking for main effects. Confounder factors are those that determine the relationship between exposure (blood type) and outcome (mortality). If there are no significant confounders then these factors really do not affect our main conclusion regarding blood types and ICU mortality; they may be more interesting but they don’t change our conclusions about medical utility of studying them as predictors of ICU mortality.<|endoftext|><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Propensity score in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


If you are interested in predicting Y given X, then use logistic regression. The probability that $Y=1$ is $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x$. This is called a linear logistic model. The coefficient on $x$ tells you how much more likely your observation is to be a 1 than 0, assuming the rest of the variables are held constant (i.e., $\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1 x)$). If you want to predict whether someone will become a fan after seeing her initial post, then this gives you a way of computing that probability for any number between 0 and 1 for $x$. If we include another feature (e.g., gender), then we can’t do it directly because we don’t know what value that feature has for each person (we could hold that fixed, but there might not be many people in each group). Instead, we hold one variable fixed at its mean so that every observation has an estimate of its effect on our outcome variable (in other words, every person becomes an average fan or non-fan over all else). In this case with enough data this should give us pretty good estimates.
Note: It would probably be good idea to see if some other predictor predicts fanhood independently from number of posts

Response: 


The model is not a probabilistic model, but rather a non-probabilistic one. In other words, we are not given p(y | do (x)) but instead are told that y depends on x via some functional relationship. This difference is important in statistical estimation theory because the two types of models make different assumptions about data distributions. The distributional assumption for estimating parameters from observational data is much weaker for non-probabilistic models than for probabilistic ones; i.e., there exists an unspecified distribution that generates all observed values of y as realizations from a fixed functional form (and hence there may be multiple values with the same probability). For example, suppose you were to draw samples from a normal distribution with unknown mean and standard deviation, then estimate the means and standard deviations by maximum likelihood estimation using those samples. The normal curve might happen to fit your observations perfectly well–but this doesn’t mean that you really know what those means and standard deviations are! It just happens that in this case they have very nice mathematical properties; i.e., they can be estimated very precisely without knowing their true values.. So although we need some sort of model for our data generating process, we don’t really care about how exactly it was generated because we aren’t interested in drawing conclusions

After class, even though my intention was not to do that straight away, as soon as we were back home (somewhere between 6.30 pm and 7 pm) I decided that today was go time. So here are the two examples of things you can try when you have just finished reading Minimal-I:

1) Look through your last 10 papers for RCTs or prospective cohort studies including an intervention and at least one outcome variable where there is difference between exposed & non-exposed groups; OR – same idea but only looking for a protective factor (i.e., anything decreasing disease risk). In case you want something more specific like blood pressure or HDL cholesterol levels, look for studies that have measured these variables using a standardized assessment like those published by AHA/NHLBI [2].

Response: 


1) what are potential outcomes? they are hypothetical quantities that you could observe, like a group of 20 rabbits before and after being given an inoculation for some disease. The difference between these hypothetical observations is called an effect or the average difference between groups.
A great example of this can be found by googling “placebo effect” if you want to see how effective placebo’s work on treating certain diseases.
2) If we have a set of treatments that vary in quality (from A-F), then we could think about all possible combinations based on all four treatments (for example, A/B/C/D). We can also think about each combination as a different treatment level or dose (e.g., 1=A, 2=B+C, 3=D). Then if we take our original population and randomly assign them into one of those 4 different levels of treatment (so there would be 25% at level 1, 25% at level 2, 25% at level 3), then every individual has some chance to be given each treatment in varying amounts. So there will likely be random variation in patients who are assigned to a specific dose based on other factors not related…just like people may weight more or less than others with otherwise similar health conditions…those who weight

(1) Take your first variable, say X.
(2) Do step 1 for all other variables except Y. (a simple graph is shown below). Now, you have a set of graphs each with one fewer edges on average than the previous graph. Call this set of graphs K_k - you know which ones are present because they contain a directed path from X to Y (the black line through the middle). This gives you a sample space S_k with n = |V| choose 2 possible subgraphs in K_k.
(3) Take your last variable, W. Add an edge from W to every vertex that is not already connected to any other vertex by an edge (i.e., add edges from W to every element in V \ {X}). Call this set R_k. Now take your sample space S_{n + 1} = S_{n} \cup R_{n}. 
(4 ) Find how many times there are no edges between two vertices v_i and v_j that have been added previously as follows:

Response: 


Using a latent variable model, one can infer that if two independent variables are associated with each other, then they must be associated with some third variable.
If $Y_i$ and $Z_i$ are independent given $\Lambda$, then 
$$E[Y_i\mid \Lambda] = E[E[Y_i\mid Z,\Lambda]] = E[\mu_{y0}+\beta_{yz}\bar{Z}]\qquad(1)$$ 
where $\bar{Z}$ is the sample mean of $Z$. So if you have a set of "observations" $(y,z)$ and want to estimate $\beta$, you could use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on the data to obtain an estimate $\hat{\beta}$, although this may not be very robust. But using equation $(1)$ above, you can use OLS to obtain an estimate for $(\hat{\beta}_{yz}, \hat{\mu}_{y0})$ even without observing all individual values of $z$. You would simply drop row observations where either both or neither values were observed for that category. When no values are observed for any particular category (say category 0), we define its estimated value as at least as large as its smallest observed value (say -infinity

a necessary condition for $X_i \perp\!\!\!\perp Y_j | Z$ is that $Y_j$ and $Z$ are conditionally independent given any conditioning set containing all other covariates, i.e. $$ P(Y_j = y, Z=z|W) = P(Y_j = y, Z=z|\hat{W}),$$ where $\hat{W}$ contains all covariates not appearing in the conditioning set.This is because if we know that $Z$ is independent of some variable or vector of variables $\tilde{y}$, then since we have a conditional independence statement with respect to a particular value for $\tilde{y}$ (namely $\tilde{y} = y$), then this conditional independence statement must hold for *all possible values* of $\tilde{y}$.It's just a matter of rearranging things slightly: $$\begin{align} &P(Y_j = y|Z=z, W) \\&= \sum_{\underset{\text{(a)}}{x}}P(\underbrace{\underbrace{(Y_i)_{i\neq j}}_{X},\text{""}_{(b)}}\text{""}_{(c)},\overbrace{\overbrace{(\underbrace{{}_i^k}_{X}, z)}_{D

 ## The explanation I heard during class of PC algorithm skeleton phase in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


You want to collect data from a region $R$ that is related to some quantity of interest $Y$. 
You define your exposure as some function, e.g. let's say you want to regress on average income in county, then $X_i = \text{income}_i$ and $\mathbb{E}(X_i)$ is average income by county, which we'll call "County". 
Then you fit a regression model for each possible value of your exposure $\mathbb{E}(X_j)$, where $j \in \{1,...,J\}$. So if there are counties with no population/population under 10K this will result in multiple models being fitted (even if you have zero observations) but this should still give better estimates than doing an unweighted regression because these counties will have less information content (weights can be assigned based on sample size). 

However, when I tried implementing this myself for the first time in R using lm() or glmulti() functions, ran into trouble with how you should choose the values of $(a,\beta)$ parameters. For example: if we were trying to predict County Income based on State Income, then how do we know what $(a,\beta)$ would look like? 
In other words - how

 ## The explanation I heard during class of test conditional independence in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


"if you are at (say) time 2, then you will not be able to control for whatever might happen at time 1"

this is a very important point that seems to be mostly lost in many explanations. for an example, take this one: given two variables $X$ and $Y$, if we want to make any inferences about their joint distribution, we need that they are independent. so for instance if we have $P(x_1=1|y_2=3)=0$ then only thing we can say is that $P(x_1=1)\leq P(x_1)$. similarly if they were dependent (e.g.: $P(x_2=0|y_2=3)=0$) then nothing would follow about joint distribution or independence of either variable on its own; but from here they can still be independent conditional on some other variables. so how do I know what's happening with my model? well, if there's something else influencing variable X besides Y at time 1 (or more precisely outside of interval [a..b] where both X and Y take values), why would this influence not change over interval [a..b]? which means it should affect X also between times a and b! but since

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Neighbourhood relations in GES in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


-When you are estimating your treatment effect or your exposure, use the **residuals** from a regression or use one of the methods mentioned here (e.g., matching on age group). Use these to estimate your outcome or propensity score. You can also try using other covariates that are not used to define strata (e.g., race, family income) but these may have correlated errors in them and so you need to be careful about what assumptions their estimated effects could violate.

[@b20] examined how different strategies for addressing clustering by neighbourhood affected estimates of programme impact when attempting to control for selection bias that might arise through differential participation rates across treated communities in an evaluation of a nationally-led community development programme using data from a large scale randomised controlled trial conducted between 2013 and 2016 in four countries, including two high-income countries (New Zealand and Scotland) and two low-middle income countries (Brazil and India). The study employed a multilevel model with random intercepts at both country level across three different levels: community level; household level within communities; individual level within households. Random intercepts were specified as normally distributed with variances estimated separately for each model specification based on restricted maximum likelihood estimation methods implemented via SAS 9 software via PROC GLIMMIX ([@b21]).

 ## The explanation I heard during class of equivalence classes in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


-Distinguish between two different types of functions, i.e., a function $f:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \bar{\mathcal{X}}$ and a function $g:\bar{\mathcal{X}}\rightarrow\bar{\mathcal{Y}}$.
A mapping is a function with codomain $\bar{\mathcal{Y}} = \mathbb R$ (allow for any transformation, i.e., equivalent results).
A congruence relation is an equivalence relation whose equivalent sets are called congruence classes (i.e., all points which have the same attribute values are considered equivalent). The set of all possible cases for an attribute value can be modeled as a discrete set, e.t., $\{1,\dots,K\}$. One would then have $K+1$ such congruence relations: one for each distinct ordered combination of values that can occur together in a set. For example ($1$,$2$) would imply that both attributes take on equal numerical values (in this case 1), and ($2$,$3$) implies that attribute 2 takes on some arbitrary but fixed value while attribute 3 takes on value 3, etc.. This allows you to consider every single case individually even though there are multiple cases per tuple taken together which will form your table/dataset $\mathbf D$.

I found this course very practical, and the professor was extremely helpful. The material is well-developed and easy to understand. The quizzes are a nice addition which allows one to double-check their understanding of the concepts being covered before moving on. I would highly recommend this class!

This class is wonderful for learning how to write research papers in a field that uses some statistical terminology but not an actuarially oriented field, e.g., epidemiology, where there are more than one variable measured (e.g., age at time of death). This course walks through the process of how to select variables for consideration as well as whether or not each variable will be considered a covariate or an independent factor in your model building process. This makes this course ideal for someone who wants to build out models from observational data sets that may not be able to control every aspect of their study because they did not set up their study with enough control groups (covariates).<|endoftext|>Q:

 ## The explanation I heard during class of independent component analysis in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


\- Use a non-linear algorithm since linear is not causal

\- Compute the SVD of covariance matrix instead of variance matrix so that you don't have to invert them at each iteration (as they are typically dense matrices)

\- Rather than computing a single component, just select components whose weights are above some threshold and discard others. Let us call those selected components _causal_ and discard others as _noise_. They do not need to be orthogonal or normalized; they just need to be uncorrelated with each other but correlated with the cause. This can be computed by generating random variables whose distribution is identical to that of cause except for their correlation with cause which is set at 0. The rest is same as usual SVD where you discard any singular values equal or below some threshold (you should also check if those left singular vectors are significant enough before discarding them - see here). In this way you will get more components than there were causes in your dataset, but only these will contribute towards explaining your data (the rest being noise), hence giving more power/precision towards inferring causal relationships between variables compared to using direct regression models which would require all covariates/features as input features for regression model fitting.

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Cocktail Party problem in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1.**State of Nature**: In this context, the state of nature is what you observe. So, for diabetes, diabetes is observed in people with a certain set of characteristics (e.g., age group).

2.**Natural Conditioning**: In this case conditioned on natural history (e..g., disease rate or death rate). This may be observable/measurable but usually not true conditioning variables. You may get some data from this or have to assume it based on your knowledge about disease progression from previous analysis/data sources or expert opinion/assumption but do not rely on this directly since you are trying out different scenarios here!

For example, if we are interested in treatment effect for a certain treatment versus no treatment then we can use placebo results as natural conditioning as long as these were obtained under similar conditions like the ones that you will use for your analysis and they are available with no missing values! The more similar condition that observations are coming from between control and experiment groups then better will be your estimates because there will be less noise related to other factors which could act like confounder variables when estimating association between treatments and outcomes!

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Simpson's Paradox in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1) You need to measure X and Y before you do any analysis (similarly, you need to measure time before you estimate a population proportion). This is important because the difference between X and Y is what changes across your units, so if there are no differences or else they're not measured consistently, then there may be no difference in A/B or C.
2) It's important that your outcome variable (A/B/C whatever) is defined by one-unit change. What this means is that each unit should have a different value for each outcome variable according to how much they change from their respective baselines. For example, if my units start out with an average age of 40 years old on both arms at baseline then on arm A this average would increase by 5% over time while on arm B it would stay constant at 5% but decrease by 0.5%. That way even when averaged over all units your two intervention arms are compared against each other based upon their individual values for "A" but not directly with "B".

 ## The explanation I heard during class of matrix of causal coefficients in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


if we have a situation that is not a DAG, lets say A $\rightarrow $B $\leftarrow$ C. In this situation, we could only estimate $C$ on B and $A$ on C, or alternatively we could use the same trick as above to estimate everything from A to B
When you are estimating coefficients from one outcome variable to another you should include all variables that precede OR come after your "dependent" variable. For example, if your dependent is Y and you want to test if X affects Y then you must also control for Z (where Z comes AFTER Y). If your independent variable is X then you should control for W (where W comes BEFORE X) but not Z (because in this caseyou want an estimate of beta(X;Z)). 

After class ended, professor asked how I would go about implementing this into R code. But he never told me what version he used so I am still lost there too! 
I understand how his example worked but not sure how his worked with more features. Like how do i extract all feature value per product ID per user id? or How can i do it if my outcome were something like percentage change in sales between products x1 and x2? Or my feature vector was just a string

 ## The explanation I heard during class of classic causality problems in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1) Find a treatment that works or some treatment $A$ which has some effect on an outcome variable $Y$. To find a treatment that might be effective, a good first step is to look at the literature and see what treatments have been shown to be effective for similar cases. This is also known as a systematic review. 
2) Treatments often have different effects on people with different characteristics/groups so you will want to find out about those characteristics/groups for your new case (or see if you can infer them from your data). The general rule of thumb is that if there are differences in effect between groups, then one should consider controlling for these differences in their analysis (e.g., by using regression). So, you want to test whether people who are poor(er) tend to do better if they receive this particular treatment or not? For example, does poverty cause worse outcomes than average and income mediate this relationship?
3) If there was no difference between groups (in terms of average pre-treatment outcomes), then this would suggest that there is no causal relationship going from group membership variable $G$to outcome variable $Y$. It might mean either: 
a) The relationship may not exist at all b) There may be other covariates/confounding variables

 ## The explanation I heard during class of truncation formula in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1.The naive approach is to use the point estimate of $\beta_0$ (in this case $1/4$) as your cutoff value for a truncated regression. This will result in very poor coverage, so you need to find another way around it. 
2.Construct a binary indicator variable that indicates whether or not a given coefficient $\beta_j$ is non-zero or zero by using an appropriate function (e.g., $x\mapsto x^2$, if you want all nonzero coefficients). 
3.Find all pairs $(X,Y)$ that have one particular coefficient equal to zero, and call this set $\{(X_i,Y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$. Note that we are implicitly assuming here that we know which pair has the offending coefficient equal to zero! 
4.Find out which values of $\beta_{0}$ give you exactly $k$-many elements of this set $\{(X_i,Y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$. For example: If $(X_{100}, Y_{100}) = (5,-8)$, then $\{\ldots,(2,-6), (-4,-10),(-8,-24),\ldots \}$ will be exactly those pairs where $\beta_{

How do we know that $\lim\limits_{x\to a} f(x) = L$ iff $f$ is continuous at $a$? Is there an example that shows discontinuity?

Let $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exist and let's suppose $f$ is continuous over $[a-r,a+r]$ where $r>0$. 
I know that since $[a-r,a+r]$ is compact then according to sequential definition of continuity$\forall \epsilon > 0,\exists \delta>0 : r<\delta\wedge |f(y)-L|<\epsilon$. And since we are given that $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$, then it follows from definition of limit that for any $\epsilon_1 > 0$, there exists some $\delta_1 > 0 : |y - x|< \

 ## The explanation I heard during class of valid adjustment set in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 

"In terms of data, if we want to know the effect of treatment X on Y with a confidence level of 95%, then we will need a sample size of 23. Since we do not have an exact knowledge about which patients are going to be assigned to each group, so we have decided that in the random assignment stage, all new cases coming into our hospital in any particular month will be assigned randomly into either Group A or Group B."
Another possible reason for why this is wrong (and maybe even my initial explanation) is that this is not really how you would use propensity score matching - which one could argue is also wrong but different than what you would do with instrumental variable or regression discontinuity methods.
So although I understand these concepts somewhat, I'd like some clarification from people who know more about statistics than me. What did Dr Stata say/do/explain when he said "You cannot change your treatment for one patient based on another"?
To elaborate more:
Dr Stata said under valid adjustment set in causal inference: "In terms of data, if we want to know the effect of treatment X on Y with a confidence level of 95%, then we will need a sample size of 23". Then he wrote his equation below (which apparently cancels out from 0=

(a) Instead of creating a set of variables for each node, we should give those variables names that are easy to remember. (b) We should also label the edges with p-values and a variable indicating whether the value is a one or zero, but if there are many edges in this way then we can give them labels from 1 to n (c) If you have many possible graph structures represented by different subsets of your data, you can create an indicator matrix NxN that represents all possible graph structures.

Response: 


a) what is the local probability distribution and how do we derive from it a single value for faithfulness?
Here, $p(y_i|do(x))$ is $\prod_{j=1}^{n} p(y_i|x,z_j)$ (See this other answer by me for why). This means that in our case, 
$$\prod_{j=1}^{3} p(y_2 | x, z = j) = \frac{p(y_2\cap z = 1| x)}{p(z = 1 \cap y = 2)} \times \frac{p({z}=3\cap y=2)}{{p}(z= 3)}.$$

 ## The explanation I heard during class of a minimal directed acyclic graph in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


A node can only be used once, so if you have an interaction with yourself in your model, you have to remove that self-interaction (and any parents) by hand or specify that they don't interact. Don't make these mistakes!
In hierarchical linear models, it is important to keep track of which variable is at what level and who's parents are who's children. This is usually done by numbering them sequentially going from left to right starting from 1 for the lowest level and working up until you get to the highest level (this works for trees too). It's also helpful to think about how many levels there are and whether a particular node belongs inside or outside each of those levels.
Don't just use random number generation functions without understanding why they work or what their distributional assumptions are. Many packages like R will use "normal" even if your data isn...

Response: 


first set up a table with n entries, each with an element (i) = 1,..,n.
then for every i in 1 to n you have to think about what you are going to do if this is not true. 
in this case the result would be "do nothing" or "ignore" -- so for every i you have an entry of (1,0). 
now connect these pairs with arrows according to which node sends information into which other node. This must happen even if it's just one arrow from A->B because we didn't know before how many arrows could go where so we don't want there being any loops!(also note that this is all part of the causal inference model.)

 ## The explanation I heard during class of the average causal effect of the treatment in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:

“Just so we’re clear, this is a particular case where you are actually testing two different versions of $y_{i,t+1}$ under different assumptions about what happens after treatment assignment. We cannot write down an equation for that because when we do that we lose our ability to detect if there is a difference in impact”
(you could also imagine something more complex like comparing treated and control groups or doing an analysis by gender)
“If our data did not have this structure, then no matter what you called your estimator, it would be biased.” (i.e. If you were able to observe an individual’s potential outcome ex post facto then your estimation technique would always be biased). 
In any case, people who are trying to get into causal inference tend to use t-tests unless they can make some sort of adjustment because it makes life easier but with care comes responsibility (like all things).

 ## The explanation I heard during class of assumption of the existence of a perfect map in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1). Under a linear model, you can get unbiased estimates by using maximum likelihood estimates (ML) or generalized least squares (GLS), but in any case the estimates are not consistent.
2). The GLS estimator is unbiased if all covariates are orthogonal to each other and to the predictions. The ML-estimator is biased unless certain orthogonality conditions hold among the covariates as well as between these and whatever function they're predicting under. 
3). To construct an asymptotically equivalent estimate that's consistent, one must use penalized ML or penalized GLS...whereas marginalization gives an estimate that's inconsistent, one must use regularization...which may be more appropriate when you have limited data, for example where you don't have enough data for cross-validation on large amounts of data because there's too much uncertainty about what your model would predict on new observations given your current distributional assumptions; 
or when there are multicollinearity problems among your covariates; or when there is additive noise [that is, measurement error]; or because you don't know whether a covariate has been measured with error.On these grounds alone we should use penalization rather than marginalization - but this will depend on how close our assumptions about conditional independence might be from being true given our existing

 ## The explanation I heard during class of counterfactual in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


The first step is to identify a contrast group. This is any group of people that are the same as you, except that they did not have exposure to some particular factor. The contrast group should be similar in all respects other than exposure to this factor. In this way, you can determine if there is any “natural” variation between these two groups of people that might contribute non-causally (i.e., not from your treatment) to your outcome variable (e.g., illness).

Next, for each individual in your study population who got sick by exposure — select one person who was exposed and one who wasn’t exposed (i.e., one from each group). These will be called cases $C_1$ and $C_2$.
Now use counterfactuals ($Y_{C1}$ for case $C_1$ and $Y_{C2}$ for case B) — these are hypothetical values of Y if C were chosen instead of B i.e., what would happen if C was treated instead of just B? Then you can calculate difference scores ($D$) between cases: $$D = Y_{c} - Y{0}$$ where c here represents either 1 or 2 depending on which individual we are talking about, meaning $$

 ## The explanation I heard during class of V structures in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:

if you are using R, the best option is to use a package called “V-struct” for causal inference. (I am not sure if there’s a package for Python). This paper is great, and even better if you can download all of its data files from https://sites.google.com/site/vstructuralcausalmodeling/. The first example code they give in class uses three variables, but then goes on to extend this idea to an arbitrary number of variables by summing up their effects into one term called a “path coefficient”. To increase readability, they also call this summation variable “Betaspace” and then have your program determine which variable(s) has(have) an effect on your dependent variable which can be accessed via e$MSE(e$BetaSpace). It would be nice if there were an easy way in Python to tell whether or not two vectors are equal without looping through each element using any built-in function that checks for equality between two lists or arrays (like e2 == e1). This seems like such a basic operation that I feel like this functionality should already exist somewhere :p!

In Swift, there are several kinds of value types which can be considered as empty if they are not initialised.

But they don't always need one because their default states is already known - EmptyString(myString:) and Array<Int>() will do just fine on both cases - but their non-empty states requires an initialization function anyway - so why should we make them conforming to some generic protocol like Equatable or Hashable?

-How to calculate the causal effect of two variables on each other (the most important step)
-How to get rid off backdoor paths from exposure $A$ towards outcome $Y$, by using only observed variables. In our example, if we observe that smoking causes heart disease ($A\rightarrow Y$), then if we do not observe that smoking causes asthma ($A \leftarrow X$), then there is no way for us to infer that smoking cause asthma. To remove this backdoor path, one needs more than one known cause for each outcome and several other assumptions need to be met.

 ## The explanation I heard during class of valid instrumental variable in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 

1) Do not measure $\hat{\beta}_2$. Instead, use a continuous instrument $Z$ that is known to be correlated with $X_i$, but not with any other potential outcome, confounders or error term (e.g. education is positively correlated with income; age is negatively correlated with income). That way you are left only with measurement error for $\hat{\beta}_2$, which has no effect on your interpretation of $\beta_1$.
2) The estimate of $\tilde{\tau}$ will be unbiased for the true ATE if you can show that all common causes of $X$ and $Z$ are also common causes of Y and Z ($\bar{C} = \bar{Y} = \bar{Z}$). It doesn't matter whether your instrument is exogenous or endogenous, so long as you have a valid IV.
3) If you actually want to interpret what this means in terms of policy changes (which probably isn't possible), then one easy way would be to run a series expansion on your OLS estimation equation: $$\newcommand{\OI}{\hat\beta}\newcommand{\OII}{\hat\tau}$$ $$\left(\begin{array}{c}y_i \\ z_i \end{array}\right)=\left(\begin
