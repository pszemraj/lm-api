 ## The explanation I heard during class of Estimating the joint density in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1.Set $\epsilon$ to an appropriate pre-determined value (e.g., 0.05)
2.For each $k$, set $c_k = 1$ if $|X_i - X_j| > \Delta$, otherwise set $c_k = 0$.
3.Set $\Delta$ to an appropriate pre-determined value (e.g., 5) or compute it using formula $(6)$ from [this paper](http://www-statlab1.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/estimationPDFsJointDensityBivariateGaussiansMixedModelsDr

 ## The explanation I heard during class of directed acyclic graph in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


a vertex can have more than one outgoing edge, but only one incoming edge.
so, (1) is ok because if there is an error in one of them, the results may be different. But if you use (2), then error propagation will happen on these edges too - causing an accumulative drift from reality. 
if a variable x causes y, then you must use y in any subsequent cause-effect analysis for x. You cannot say "x causes z" and "z causes y", because z may not exist yet when we say that "y is caused by x". It's not wrong to say it though - just redundant! We

 ## The explanation I heard during class of d-separation in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 

"In a perfect world, we would want to run this analysis right on our data, but sometimes we have to use proxies. So the first step is to use a multivariate machine learning algorithm. The second step is find a measure of association between each variable and outcome (here you could try either chi-square or correlation)".
Unfortunately, that explanation was from my class notes which I never took verbatim so I don't know if they included an example of how you would do that with R! but being able to figure out exactly what they meant by "find a measure"would be really helpful for me!
I know this isn't directly related

 ## The explanation I heard during class of DAG factorization in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 

1) The intuition of "each node is only influenced by its parents."
2) The solution space for a causal model (how you could prove there exists no other solutions, etc.)
3) And how to solve it with a greedy strategy.
I would like to see a more thorough version of this explanation, one that may include 3-4 problems with some text and working code. For example, I think the code below gives an intuitive idea about DAG factorization; however, it doesn't explain why we should perform this operation in this order...so if someone knows how to better explain these points above then please let me know!

 ## The explanation I heard during class of front door criterion in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 
 "if you are trying to argue that all g's cause h, and you have evidence that says g does not cause h, then you should think about how this affects your d-connection." So, when we finally get around to using this idea, what is important is knowing how to correctly implement it.

Also, it was nice hearing about MIMIC and its use in making inferences from graphs. If someone knows an easier way of implementing them than on slide 25 then please tell me!

I also really enjoyed hearing Dr. Edwards' lecture on "Bayesian Networks". The discussion afterward helped immensely as well because he explained his approach more clearly than he did

 ## The explanation I heard during class of backdoor criterion in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


is there a specific cause? no
is there a specific effect? yes
is there an interaction term between x & y? yes, but not worth using 
are you interested in main effects only? no, use main effects + interactions instead of bivariate regression (interactions are not identifiable when you have two independent variables)

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Observational distribution in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


-the order of the data must be taken into account (when you treat a time series, you must make sure that if A causes B, then A happened before B)
-be consistent in your notation between $P(Y|do(X))$ and $P(Y|X)$
-the same for $P(A)$ and $\Pr(A|B=x)$, etc. even if you find them equal to one another they are not necessarily identical because there is an additional constraint that they have to satisfy (but I don't remember what) 
-you can do this with more than two variables but only when

 ## The explanation I heard during class of interventional distribution in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1.The difference in covariate distribution between treated and control is not necessarily zero if there are unobserved confounding variables.

2.One way to account for this is to fit a model that accounts for these unobserved confounders, usually after first fitting a simpler model (standard regression) that does not include the variables we think may be confounders. This second step is called "adjusting" for unmeasured covariates or "adjustment." We typically assume that this second step will make our estimate closer to being unbiased, but no one knows whether or how much it does so without seeing the full data set with all covariates in place---which we can

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Instrumental variable in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


You need a valid instrument (such as age) you can use to identify causal effects of interest – that’s where things get tricky, because there are tons of instruments out there that could be used for this purpose. Instead of using one instrument to predict Y_i1 and another instrument to predict Y_i2, we use all available instruments (say m = 10) so that m*2 unknown parameters are needed to estimate the model. That means you need 10 observations per unit time period for each individual i. The idea is not perfect compliance per se, but complier average CACE if you want an estimate for complier differences in treatment effect (C

 ## The explanation I heard during class of marginal distribution in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1)You have a valid causal model, which is very important and cannot be skipped. It is easy to get caught up in models. 

2)You want a sample from $p(y_{j} \mid x_{j}, d, D)$ 
the true value of this density can be found by simple plug-ins (conditional independence). 

3)Then you can just ignore the other variables since they do not matter for your calculation of that density. I think that this step will always hold since all you care about is getting an estimate for $p(y_{j} \mid x_{j},d)$,

 ## The explanation I heard during class of conditional distribution in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 

1) You need to have a proper (multivariate) model for your variables, also called covariates or explanatory variables. The list of covariates should include all observable characteristics that you can think of that might be related to cause and effect: age, gender, income, education, etc. Let's call this the X matrix since we will assign a value to every combination (xij in R):

 ## The explanation I heard during class of interventional distribution in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1.Step 1 - check for monotonicity, add variables until there is non-monotonicity;

2.Step 2 - consider cumulative effects, add variables that are not back-door causes;

3.Step 3 - check for exclusion restrictions on the treatment variable, use a subset of data to test them; if they hold you can drop them from your model and use a reduced set of covariates in your estimation equation; if they do not hold you should drop all covariates (and their interactions) that have an inclusion restriction with the treatment variable (i.e., remove those covariates from analysis); you could also include them as

 ## The explanation I heard during class of global Markov property in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


we assume that $Y_t$ is independent of $\mathcal{F}_t$ given $Y_{t+1}$, and we will show this conditional independence holds. 
we take a look at two cases for $P(y_{1:T} | do(y_0))$: (i) when $y_{0}$ is fixed, then we can compute the joint probability from left to right as in case 1; (ii) when $y_0 = \emptyset$, then we have no conditioning on any variable, so it's just a product over all random variables in our model. 

This might be really obvious to most

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Propensity score in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 

First, don't use the term "treatment effect" for what you want to measure. It is a confusing term with a lot of baggage that doesn't apply here. There is no treatment being applied in this case; there are no units going from 0 to 1 or vice versa, just a change in one variable caused by another being held constant.
Second, assume you have a large number of observations and a few potential predictors (all cause/effect pairs) that might be related to your outcome variable(s), which can vary across your sample (i.e., each subject could differ on multiple variables). The only way you can use these predictors with any certainty is

 ## The explanation I heard during class of the positivity assumption in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


If variable A is positively correlated with B, but not causally related, then data indicates that there is a "third" variable C which affects both A and B so that A ≠ c ⇒ AC ≠ 0. (Correlation does not imply causation). If data shows no correlation or negative correlation, we cannot make any inferences on this model.
(I'm still trying to wrap my head around this... perhaps someone can explain further?) 
A few ways to think about why you should use this approach: 
(1) It's very intuitive -- we usually think of correlations between two variables (e.g., body temp and heart

1) The calculation of $Y_i^{*}$
Let $\Delta_i = Y_{i} - \overline{Y}$, where $\overline{Y} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i}/n$. Then $Y_i^{*}$ is the solution, not necessarily unique, to the following minimization problem:

 ## The explanation I heard during class of minimal I-map in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1)Take a $Y$ variable, which is random (based on data), represent the observed outcomes. For example, one could code income from 0 to 45 k$. 
2)Likewise, take a $X$ variable (which is also random), represent the values of explanatory variables X_k that would be observed with probability 1 for all k.[I would imagine this as an average over all possible realizations of the set of explanatory variables.] For example, if you have four explanatory variables (with 5 levels each), then there are only 1024 possible combinations for these explanatory variables and thus your X_k are binary with probability 1

 ## The explanation I heard during class of distribution in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


it's not enough to do a chi square test with just your variable of interest (e.g., x_1) and the outcome (e.g., y); you need to include all other variables related to your predictor variable, because that's where you get confounding, which would contribute noise and prevent a significant result; for example, if x_1 is the number of hours spent on an activity yesterday, then also including age might be useful since people who are older might spend more time on an activity than people who are younger; however, including age as part of your model doesn't make sense if you are trying to see how much effect each additional

Response: 
 "you don't need to start from a complete case-control or test data set.

In addition, at a previous job, we were given just an excel file with the necessary variables and no cases or controls. We had to use this data for research purposes but there was no sample size estimation and therefore we didn't know how many cases/controls would have been needed nor did we have any sense of what effect size would be acceptable (the only type of analysis that was possible at that time). That's when my professor's response (that he asked us not to share with others) made more sense than when he explained why unique mI is not useful in practice

 ## The explanation I heard during class of joint independence in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


A graph of a random variable X is independent from another variable Y if and only if there exists a subset A of values that the variables can take such that P(X=a|Y) = P(X=a) for all possible values of Y, where “|” is used to denote “such that”. The set A is called the relevant set.

 ## The explanation I heard during class of minimal Markov in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then every function of $(X,Y)$ is also independent of $Y$.
Thus if you want to test for independence, you can instead add a constant (or any other amount) to each variable separately. If they are still dependent, then they're not independent. 
This would be especially helpful when trying to find out whether two variables are influenced by two different things (say you observe heart-rate and think that stress might be affecting it). You can now just compare this new situation with your original data set without having any influence from stress.

 ## The explanation I heard during class of PC algorithm in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


I can only assume this is a very simple example (although it's hard to tell from your question). It says that $X$ is not independent of $Y$. So if you want cause and effect you can't use $X$ as an instrument for $Y$. However, if they are mutually independent then there is no reason why they should be related. The issue here is that the independence assumption may lead to biased estimates or even invalidity of your test (see What statistical issues arise when searching for causal effects with instrumental variables?).
So what does this mean? Well, the two are not necessarily causally related. Then what?Maybe you should try

 ## The explanation I heard during class of PC algorithm skeleton phase in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1) Divide data into 2 sets (training and test).
2) Set sample size for “training” set at 1/4th of the “test” set size. (I didn’t quite understand why this is a good idea, but then again, maybe my brain doesn’t need to know that yet!)
3) Run “training” with random data split for 5-20 iterations. This is an important point because you want to ensure that all possible splits are tested before selecting your final model (so that you don’t get lucky). The number of iterations depends on how much time you have available and whether or not your computer can

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Markov equivalence in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1) the fact that we can always find a function $f$ so that for all $y_i, x_i$, $P(y_i=1\mid do(x_i)) = P(f(x, \mathcal{B})=1)$ where $\mathcal{B} = (y_{< i}, x_{< i})$ and 
2) the restriction on $f$ is that for every $\{x\}, \{x'\}$ with equal probability under $\mathbb{P}$, $\{y\} = \{f(\{\bar{0}\})\}$ whenever $(X, Y)$ has equal probability under $\mathbb{Q

 ## The explanation I heard during class of test conditional independence in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


In a regression we need 2 variables in order to predict the value of one, either variable holding all others constant. The regression equation is Y = B1 + B2X1+B3X2 ........ (the usual linear equation) but then when you analyse a sample from this population and regress that against X3, you get another linear equation because now Y is on one side of a unit blance with X3 and so you have Y = B1 + B2X13+B4X32......because now each variable has only 2 terms. So there is not reason for assuming that X1 & X2 are independent when we are reg

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Neighbourhood relations in GES in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


Every node is a player with a single strategy (the next action) but no information (so you can’t see other nodes’ strategies). A message is sent between every pair of adjacent nodes, so that if A can send $M_1$ and B can send $M_2$, then they will both get them. At each round, every node has some probability to act according to its strategy. In particular, the probability for an agent acting depends on its own observed actions and the number of messages it has received from different sources since they were last updated. To illustrate this, assume that each node has two possible actions: go left or go right with

 ## The explanation I heard during class of equivalence classes in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


For B, we have 2 cases, A is in front or after. Write out all 2^n possible sequences of times where A is before B. Find a rule that will select those sequences where A comes before B every time with the least number of exceptions possible. That is the smallest equivalence class (this almost certainly uses transitivity). Now take all pairs from this set except for one pair (called a representative sequence) that you can find by inspection and then remove these two from each other's sets until you are down to just one representative sequence left, which should be your final answer to whether or not there was any effect for A on B

 ## The explanation I heard during class of independent component analysis in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1) choose a random seed (this is important, because if you run this multiple times on your dataset, you would get different results). If there are several sets of variables that have high mutual information with each other, run this on each individually. That way, you will find out which are the most important ones (the ones with lowest p-values) and which are not important at all. This helps us identify what is affecting what!

2) if we know that there are X number of input variables and one output variable Y, then we can form a graph that connects all the X’s to all Y’s with arrows representing their dependencies (

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Cocktail Party problem in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


The general method is to make a very simple model for treatment selection (this is all we know). The distributional assumption here may be quite strong (it has nothing to do with your particular application) but that’s OK because we know nothing about your population. For example, if you have a binary variable indicating whether or not someone receives treatment (treatment=1, control=0), then something like this might hold: p(treatment|x)=p(treat|prob(treat)*prob(x)) where x is some vector of covariates and prob() is the probability function from classical statistics. In this case, if there are no covariates other than x and

 ## The explanation I heard during class of Simpson's Paradox in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1) The difference between treatment and control group is not significant. This is only a very weak statement, but one that has been made many times in medical journals over the past year or so. What do you call a statement that you can reject? 
2) The percent reduction for treatment group vs control is much higher than would be expected by chance; this would suggest that there may be a real effect (even though it may not have been statistically significant). However, if we assume there is no relationship at all between the 2 groups, then we are forced to conclude (at least before looking at numbers) that there must either be some kind of relationship or else

Response: 


1) Existence and uniqueness of maximum likelihood estimator in linear models (this is a well known result, but my professor’s proof was very clear). The model needs to satisfy some regularity conditions, which are satisfied by all standard linear models.
2) How to calculate the coefficient corresponding to each variable on both sides of an equation when there are several variables. Easily done using partial derivatives (for this step you do not need your model matrix because you can work back and forth between matrices and vectors).

Response: 


1.) For each non-terminal node in G, create a marker variable that is equal to 1 if that node is not in the current adjustment set, else 0. That way you can get a sense of how much you are missing when looking at which nodes are present and which are not (and thereby what other adjustments may be available). Let’s call this marker variable w.
2.) Set up an equation for each edge from t to s where s is not in the current adjustment set (w = 0) but t0 does participate in some other adjustment subset(s) also without w (t0 participates, but with other variables or parameters). Call

Response: 

-identify all potential causes
-add a variable for each cause, with an indicator function that is equal to 1 if that cause occurred (and 0 otherwise)
-create a new variable (the outcome or dependent variable) as the difference between two variables, one of which includes those indicators (indicators allow us to "explain away" any portion of variance due to those factors)
-only use the remaining independent variables for prediction and interpretation

 ## The explanation I heard during class of general Identification strategies in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1\. Identify all independent variables, including any that are not observed. In this example, you would identify all the treatments (which may be a mixture of doses and schedules).

2\. Look for "instruments" or "surrogates" (I forget what we called them) for each independent variable. This is where your judgement needs to be applied in choosing which potential instruments to use. Does something about these particular treatments make other things about them more likely? If so, then they can potentially be used as instruments (in order for them to satisfy this condition, you will also need an unconfoundedness assumption). In this example there is only

 ## The explanation I heard during class of causal skeleton structure in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


1) do not use cause as a variable because then you are learning about what causes what, but rather you are trying to model the mechanism that generates data.
2) treat each outcome variable as a “causal effect” and include those in your analysis. You can think of this step by imagining that each path from $X$ to $Y$ is a set of conditions, where those conditions can be manipulated (like in an experiment). You know which paths exist in your data, so if you can find ones that match up with those paths then there’s a good chance they’re causing something similar when conditioned on other variables (this is known as

 ## The explanation I heard during class of faithfulness vs the global Markov in causal inference was possibly the best I had ever heard. it included the steps to implement it and useful details such as:
Response: 


P(b|do(a,b)) = P(b|a) * P(do(a,b)) / P(do(a)) if you are only interested in one of b or a is a function of a.

This is not like a chain rule where you ignore those steps that look backwards and just multiply your probabilities forward. It’s worth taking time to understand and derive this equation if you can because then you can calculate it for yourself (and use stats software to actually do all this) rather than having someone explain everything each time you ask an ML question. A lot of people don’t seem to know how so

use a lag of 1 or 2 for any variable that does not have a perfect correlation with its neighbor (if you can).
